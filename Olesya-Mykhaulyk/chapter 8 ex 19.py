# Parsing for such sentences is really difficult because the great role
# here play pragmatics, semantics and other factors describing the
# extralinguistic context. Even a human needs to read such a sentence few times
# and analyze it in few different ways, so it is more complicated to develop
# such process for a machine. The main point is that it is important to 
# choose the right strategy in order to find out the true meaning and such strategy can
# differ from sentence to sentence.
