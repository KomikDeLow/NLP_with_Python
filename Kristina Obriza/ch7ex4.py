## Obriza Khrystyna , AL-11, Chapter 7, Task 4. 
##The task was to create a chunker that starts with the sentence in one chunk.
##To determine those tags which will probably fill the holes with the help of effective program


import nltk

("leader", "NN"), ("in", "IN"), ("mobile", "JJ"), ("technology", "NN"), ("with", "IN"),("In-line", "JJ"), ("combination", "NN"),
("processes", "NNS"), ("for", "IN"), ("the", "DT"),("label", "NN"), ("industry", "NN"),
("one", "CD"), ("of", "IN"), ("the", "DT"), ("fastest", "JJS"),("developing", "VBG"), ("trends", "NNS"), ("today", "NN")]

cp = nltk.RegexpParser(grammar)  ## we created a chunk parser with a help of that grammar
result = cp.parse(sentence)
print cp
print result
            ## test it on our example sentence
## one can examine the results using  procedure - print result - the result can be a tree, or with the help of - result.draw()- displayed graphically
