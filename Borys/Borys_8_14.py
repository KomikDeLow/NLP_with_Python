# You can modify the grammar in the recursive descent parser demo by selecting
# Edit Grammar in the Edit menu. Change the first expansion production, namely
# NP -> Det N PP,  to  NP -> NP PP. Using the Step button, try to build a parse tree.

#  Program stucks (infinite loop) on the firs rule.
#  It's recurring, that's why analyzer won't move to the next rule.
