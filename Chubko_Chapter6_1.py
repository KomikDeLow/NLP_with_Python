#Modeling of corpus linguistic data can help us to understtand thelanguage models and is used to predict new language data.
#Classifiers use trained corpuses for building models, taking toconsideration the specific input, they can perform a wide range of tasks,including
#classification of documents, definition of language and segmentingof sentences.
#It is important to use a large amount of new data which wasnot trained previously. Otherwise the result can be not justified
