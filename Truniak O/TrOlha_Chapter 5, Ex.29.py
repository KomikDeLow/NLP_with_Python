# Recall the example of a bigram tagger which encountered a word it hadnâ€™t seen
# during training, and tagged the rest of the sentence as None. It is possible for a
# bigram tagger to fail partway through a sentence even if it contains no unseen words
# (even if the sentence was used during training). In what circumstance can this
# happen? Can you write a program to find some examples of this?

# In the following code sample, we train a unigram tagger, use it to tag a sentence, and then evaluate:
