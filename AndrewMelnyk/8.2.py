# "However" Without a Comma: Modifier
# The comma is important because however is a conjunctive adverb that can be used in two different ways: it can join main clauses and it can modify a clause.
# If you use however at the beginning of a sentence and don't insert a comma, however means Уin whatever manner,Ф Уto whatever extent,Ф or Уno matter how.Ф
# For instance, Winston Churchill said, УHowever beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results,Ф and for those of you who like more
# modern examples, on the TV show House, Dr. Foreman said, УHowever bad you think youТre going to be in that room, not being there is worse.Ф
# In both those cases, however isn't playing a role as a conjunction. It's not joining anything to anything else. It means Уno matter how.Ф
# УHowever bad you think youТre going to beФ and УNo matter how bad you think youТre going to beФ mean the same thing. I don't think anyone has ever
# disputed starting a sentence with however when it is used that way.  

# "However" with a Comma: Connector
# On the other hand, Strunk and White did say in their book, The Elements of Style, that you shouldn't start a sentence with however when you mean УneverthelessФ or Уbut.Ф
# TheyТre referring to sentences such as this one from Charles DickensТ Nicholas Nickleby, УIt is a great deal easier to go down hill than up. However,
# they kept on, with unabated perseverance,Ф and this more modern example from the 2009 УStar TrekФ movie in which Spock says, УI intend to assist in the effort
# to reestablish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale is better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I will gladly defer to your medical expertise.Ф
# In these examples, however is acting as a connector. ItТs providing a transition from the previous sentence to the next sentence.
# I know many of you revere Strunk and White, but this is one instance in which nearly all modern style guides have decided that the classic advice is
# unreasonable. The modern style guides donТt call starting a sentence with however an error.
# Here's why: when you put a comma after however at the beginning of a sentence, everyone knows it means Уnevertheless.Ф There's no reason to outlaw
# a perfectly reasonable use of the word when you can solve the problem with a comma. Some writers have even gone so far as to say it is preferable to start
# sentences with however instead of burying the word in the middle of a sentence, because putting it at the beginning makes the connection between sentences more clear and therefore makes the text easier to scan.
