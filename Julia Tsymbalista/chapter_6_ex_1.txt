Read up on one of the language technologies mentioned in this section, such as
word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, question answering, machine
translation, or named entity recognition. Find out what type and quantity of annotated
data is required for developing such systems. Why do you think a large
amount of data is required?



Regarding machine translation, it is difficult because a given words could have several possible translations(depending on its meaning), and because word order must be changed in keeping with the grammatical structure of the target language. 
Also the machine should be able to translate the text into another language, accurately conveying the meaning of the original text.
For example In translating into French or German, we are forced to choose the gender of the
pronoun and a correct translation actually depends on correct understanding
of the pronoun.

That's why working out the sense of a word, the subject of a verb, and the
antecedent of a pronoun are steps in establishing the meaning of a sentence, things we
would expect a language understanding system to be able to do.

 
A large quantity of annotated data is needed to develop such software due to the complexity of the problem and various contexts in which  given words can occur. As with part-of-speach tagging, the more data a tagger sees in training, the more accurate it will be when asked to process new data.
